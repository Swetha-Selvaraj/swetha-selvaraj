# Hi, I’m Swetha 

Software Engineer focused on **Agentic AI worklows** that solve real enterprise problems.

---

## What I do
- Build **GenAI products** (using RAG, agentic workflows)
- Worked on **observability & auto-remediation** for infra use case and hrms.
- Design **cloud-native microservices** on AWS

## Selected work

**Infra Observability & Auto-Remediation**  
- Built an AIOps agent combining metrics, logs, incidents, and runbooks  
- Designed RCA workflows and anomaly detection pipelines  
- Implemented automated remediation via ServiceNow workflows  

**Cloud Migration Strategy Planner**  
- Built an cloud instance recommendation engine using Agentic RAG which analyses the current spec and recommends right sizing instance and automatically pulls out pricing details using CSP Pricing APIs 
- And built scheduler for migration planning that's aware of app dependency, team bandwidth and gives the wave and move-group planning.  
- Reduced manual migration planning effort by ~15%  

**HR AI Suite**  
- Built an muti-tenant HR knowledge agent using which pulls out the data from relational databases and from knowledge graphs which is created using unstructured data (performance reports, policy documents)
- Accesed via RBAC,Performed PII masking/redaction, guardrails check before retrival.
